# Advanced Software Engineering (in Mechanical Engineering)

- The aim of the course is to explain students for what purposes, under which conditions and with which consequences computer systems are used for the solution of problems **related to Mechanical Engineering**.
- Within the first part of the course the steps from problem description to the final software solution are illustrated. This covers the topics 
    - modelling, 
    - problem elicitation and analysis, 
    - program design and 
    - an introduction to UML (Unified Modelling Language). 
- Then the course goes on with a closer examination of the various aspects which comprise software development, concerning with topics like 
    - design patterns, 
    - agile software processes and 
    - project management. 
- Parallel to the lecture the students are given the chance to employ the theoretical input from the course in small software projects. 
- After an **introduction to the basics of Java** and object-oriented programming, the students stepwise pass through the particular stages of a software development process.
