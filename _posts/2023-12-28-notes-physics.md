# Physics

## SI Units

### Tesla

magnetic field strength, aka magnetic flux density

**Gauss**: 1 G = 100 μT (cgs system)

- 25 to 65 μT - Earth's magnetic field (depends on latitude, longitude)
- 5 mT - the strength of a typical refrigerator magnet
- 1 T - magnet used to move a large amount of metal (like a car in a junkyard)
- 1.5 T to 3 T - strength of medical MRI systems in practice, experimentally up to 17 T
- 16 T - magnetic levitation of a live **frog**
  - Operation of this electromagnet used in the frog levitation experiment required 4 MW of power
- 97.4 T - world record on Earth, strongest magnetic field produced by a "non-destructive" magnet (the Los Alamos National Laboratory)
  - held for approximately 1 millisecond
  - **non-destructive**: "This advance improves our ability to create **non-destructive** magnetic fields – higher-power magnets routinely rip themselves to pieces due to the large forces involved – that serve as tools to study the fundamental characterization of advanced materials such as graphene or high-temperature superconductors."
- 100 T - approximate magnetic field strength of a typical **white dwarf star**
- 100 MT - 100 GT – magnetic strength range of **magnetar neutron stars**
