# Interpreting a PR Curve

- It is desired that the algorithm should have both high precision, and high recall. However, most machine learning algorithms often involve a trade-off between the two. **A good PR curve has greater AUC (area under curve)**. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/precision-recall-curve-ml/)

## Relation to ROC Curve

- In certain applications (e.g. searching a pool of documents to find ones which are relevant to a particular user query) PR curves are more useful than ROC curves.
- It is important to note that the classifier that has a higher AUC on the **ROC curve** will always have a higher AUC on the PR curve as well. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/precision-recall-curve-ml/)
