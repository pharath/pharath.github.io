    <p>However, when calculating the <strong>depth</strong> of a deep neural network, we only consider the layers that have tunable weights. <a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/14033/115254">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Forward-mode differentiation</strong> starts at an input to the graph and moves towards the end. At every node, it sums all the paths feeding in. Each of those paths represents one way in which the input affects that node. By adding them up, we get the total way in which the node is affected by the input, it’s derivative. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Reverse-mode differentiation</strong>, on the other hand, starts at an output of the graph and moves towards the beginning. At each node, it merges all paths which originated at that node. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I say that reverse-mode differentiation gives us the derivative of e with respect to every node, I really do mean <strong>every node</strong>. We get both $\frac{\partial e}{\partial a}$ and $\frac{\partial e}{\partial b}$, the derivatives of $e$ with respect to both inputs. Forward-mode differentiation gave us the derivative of our output with respect to a single input, but reverse-mode differentiation gives us all of them. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When training neural networks, we think of the cost (a value describing how bad a neural network performs) as a function of the parameters (numbers describing how the network behaves). We want to calculate the derivatives of the <strong>cost with respect to all the parameters</strong>, for use in gradient descent. Now, there’s often millions, or even tens of millions of parameters in a neural network. So, <strong>reverse-mode differentiation, <mark>called</mark> backpropagation</strong> [<a href="#reverse_mode_accumulation">more precise: reverse_mode_accumulation</a>] in the context of neural networks, gives us a massive speed up!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Are there any cases <strong>where forward-mode differentiation makes more sense</strong>? Yes, there are! Where the reverse-mode gives the derivatives of one output with respect to all inputs, the forward-mode gives us the derivatives of all outputs with respect to one input. If one has a function with lots of outputs, forward-mode differentiation can be much, much, much faster.)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>both are algorithms for efficiently computing the sum by factoring the paths. Instead of summing over all of the paths explicitly, they compute the same sum more efficiently by <mark>**merging paths back together at every node**</mark>. In fact, <strong>both</strong> algorithms touch each edge exactly once!
    <ul>
      <li>At each node, reverse-mode differentiation merges all paths which <strong>originated</strong> at that node (starting at an output of the graph and moving towards the beginning)</li>
      <li>At each node, forward-mode differentiation sums all the paths <strong>feeding into</strong> that node (starting at the beginning and moving towards an output of the graph)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>forward-mode: apply operator $\frac{\partial}{\partial X}$</li>
  <li>reverse-mode: apply operator $\frac{\partial Z}{\partial}$</li>
  <li>if we have e.g. a hundred inputs, but only one output, reverse-mode differentiation gives a speed up in $\mathcal{O}(\text{# Inputs})$ compared to forward-mode differentiation</li>

<ul>
  <li>In the above examples, we had to <strong>manually</strong> implement both the forward and backward passes of our neural network. Manually implementing the backward pass is not a big deal for a small two-layer (?: siehe Stichpunkt) network, but can quickly get very hairy for large complex networks.
    <ul>
      <li>?: Why “two-layer”:
        <ul>
          <li>The previous polynomial regression examples correspond to a <strong>single</strong> layer perceptron with a fixed nonlinear transformation of the inputs (here: using polynomial basis functions), so why does Johnson say <strong>two</strong>-layer perceptron?
            <ul>
              <li>What Johnson probably means here is that, basically, implementing backprop <strong>manually</strong> (like in the previous polynomial regression examples) for a two-layer NN would be possible without autograd. This “two-layer network”, however, does not refer to the previous polynomial regression models!</li>

  <li>Thankfully, we can use <strong>automatic differentiation</strong> to automate the computation of backward passes in neural networks. The <strong>autograd</strong> package in PyTorch provides exactly this functionality. When using autograd, the forward pass of your network will define a <strong>computational graph</strong>; nodes in the graph will be Tensors, and edges will be functions that produce output Tensors from input Tensors. Backpropagating through this graph then allows you to easily compute gradients.

      <li>“That algorithm specifies the <strong>forward propagation</strong> computation, which we could put in a graph $\mathcal{G}$. In order to perform <strong>back-propagation</strong>, we can construct a computational graph that depends on $\mathcal{G}$ and adds to it an extra set of nodes. These form a <strong>subgraph</strong> $\mathcal{B}$ with one node per node of $\mathcal{G}$. Computation in $\mathcal{B}$ proceeds in exactly the reverse of the order of computation in $\mathcal{G}$, and each node of $\mathcal{B}$ computes the derivative $\frac{\partial u^{(n)}}{\partial u^{(i)}}$ associated with the <strong>forward graph</strong> node $u^{(i)}$.” (Goodfellow, Bengio)</li>

<h4 id="relation-to-backprop">Relation to Backprop</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Backprop stores the $y_i^{(k-1)}$ during the forward pass and re-uses it during the backward pass to calculate $\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{ji}^{(k-1)}}=y_i^{(k-1)}\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{ji}^{(k-1)}}$ (memoization, Dynamic Programming)</li>
  <li>During the backward pass Backprop visits each edge only once (see above) and gradients that have already been calculated are saved in memory (cf. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grad_table[u[i]]</code> in Algo 6.2 or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code> in Algo 6.4 Goodfellow, Bengio)! (memoization, Dynamic Programming)
    <ul>
      <li>this is analogous to the Fibonacci Sequence Algo’s map <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> (see above) which saves the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fib(n − 1) + fib(n − 2)</code> that have already been calculated in memory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(cf. Figure 6.9 in Goodfellow, Bengio) Back-propagation avoids the exponential explosion in <strong>repeated subexpressions</strong></li>
  <li>similar to the Fibonacci example “the back-propagation algorithm is designed to reduce the number of common subexpressions <strong>without regard to memory</strong>.” (Goodfellow, Bengio)</li>
  <li>“When the memory required to store the value of these expressions is low, the back-propagation approach of equation 6.52 <img src="/assets/images/goodfellow_ml/Goodf_6_50-6_53.png" alt="6.52" /> is clearly preferable because of its reduced runtime. However, equation 6.53 is also a valid implementation of the chain rule, and is useful <strong>when memory is limited</strong>.” (Goodfellow, Bengio)</li>

<h3 id="sgd">SGD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros:
    <ul>
      <li>is usually much faster than batch learning
        <ul>
          <li>consider large redundant data set
            <ul>
              <li>example: training set of size 1000 is inadvertently composed of 10 identical copies of a set with 100 samples</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>also often results in better solutions because of the noise in the updates
        <ul>
          <li>because the noise present in the updates can result in the weights jumping into the basin of another, possibly deeper, local minimum. This has been demonstrated in certain simplified cases</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>can be used for tracking changes
        <ul>
          <li>useful when the function being modeled is changing over time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Small batches can offer a <strong>regularizing effect</strong> (Wilson and Martinez, 2003), <strong>perhaps due to the noise they add</strong> to the learning process. <strong>Generalization error is often best</strong> for a batch size of 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cons:
    <ul>
      <li>noise also prevents full convergence to the minimum
        <ul>
          <li>Instead of converging to the exact minimum, the convergence stalls out due to the <strong>weight fluctuations</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>size</strong> of the fluctuations depend on the degree of noise of the stochastic updates:
                <ul>
                  <li>The variance of the fluctuations around the local minimum is proportional to the learning rate $\eta$
                    <ul>
                      <li>which in turn is inversely proportional to the number of patterns presented $\eta\propto\frac{c}{t}$ [see paper]</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>“So in order <strong>to reduce the fluctuations</strong> we can either”
                <ol>
                  <li>“decrease (anneal) the learning rate or”
                    <ul>
                      <li>start with large $\eta$ and decrease $\eta$ as the training proceeds</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>“have an adaptive batch size.”
                    <ul>
                      <li>start with small mini-batch size $t$ and increase mini-batch size $t$ as the training proceeds
        - determining an appropriate $t$ is as difficult as determining an appropriate $\eta$ and, therefore, methods (i) and (ii) are equally efficient at reducing these weight fluctuations</li>
                      <li>Note: This is <strong>only valid in the noise regime at the end of training</strong> and not a general rule for training!
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>in the beginning of the training</strong> for a non-convex, non-quadratic error surface simple rules like this one do not apply, i.e. increasing the mini-batch size may have a different effect than decreasing the learning rate!</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>however, this weight fluctuation problem may be “less severe than one thinks because of <strong>generalization</strong>”
                <ul>
                  <li>i.e. “<strong>Overtraining</strong> may occur long before the <strong>noise regime</strong> is even reached.”</li>

<h3 id="batch-gd">Batch GD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros:
    <ul>
      <li>Conditions of convergence are <strong>well understood</strong>.</li>
      <li>Many <strong>acceleration techniques</strong> (most <a href="#2nd_order_methods">2nd order methods</a>, e.g. conjugate gradient) only operate in batch learning.</li>
      <li>Theoretical analysis of the weight dynamics and convergence rates are simpler</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cons:
    <ul>
      <li>redundancy can make batch learning much slower than on-line</li>
      <li>often results in worse solutions because of the absence of noise in the updates
        <ul>
          <li>will discover the minimum of whatever basin the weights are initially placed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>changes go undetected and we obtain rather bad results since we are likely to average over several rules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mini-batch-gd">Mini-batch GD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>LeCun “Efficient BackProp”:
    <ul>
      <li>Another method to remove noise [in SGD] is to use “mini-batches”, that is, start with a small batch size and increase the size as training proceeds.
        <ul>
          <li>However, deciding the rate at which to increase the batch size and which inputs to include in the small batches is as difficult as determining the proper learning rate. <strong>Effectively the size of the learning rate in stochastic learning corresponds to the respective size of the mini batch.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Note also that the problem of removing the noise in the data may be less critical than one thinks because of generalization. <strong>Overtraining may occur long before the noise regime is even reached.</strong></li>
    </ul>

  <li>[Jastrzębski, S., Kenton, Z., Arpit, D., Ballas, N., Fischer, A., Bengio, Y., &amp; Storkey, A., (2018, October), “<strong>Width of Minima</strong> Reached by Stochastic Gradient Descent is Influenced by <strong>Learning Rate to Batch Size Ratio</strong>”]
    <ul>
      <li>The authors give the mathematical and empirical foundation to the idea that the <strong>ratio of learning rate to batch size</strong> influences the generalization capacity of DNN. They show that this ratio plays a major role in the <strong>width of the minima</strong> found by SGD. <strong>The higher ratio the wider is minima and better generalization</strong>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55690257">source</a></li>

        <ul>
          <li>these bounds provide intellectual justification that machine learning algorithms can work</li>

                  <li>the more dimensions you have the more “unlikely” (if you construct a function with some randomness and you choose independently whether a direction starting from the critical point goes up or down) it gets that <strong>all</strong> the directions go up at a critical point
                    <ul>
                      <li>this gets <strong>exponentially</strong> more unlikely with each additional dimension!</li>

                              <li>this means, you have local minima [for high-dimensional functions], but they are very close to the global minimum in terms of their objective function</li>

                  <li>you see the error go down and it plateaus and then, if you are lucky, something happens and then it goes down again and it plateaus again and then we might think this is the best we can get, <strong>but</strong> the gradients do not approach zero, what’s going on?

                      <li>my intuition is that this such a high-dimensional space that there is only a few dimensions where it is going down and somehow simple Gradient Descent is not finding them (maybe because of curvature problems [Goodfellow_2016, Fig. 4.5] or other things)
                        <ul>
                          <li>What I’m saying is, yes, it is worthwhile to continue exploring other optimization algorithms beyond simple GD, but we need to take into account the fact that maybe what we are fighting is not local minima, it might be something else.

                  <li>as you go further down it spends more and more time on these plateaus (and it gets harder and harder to decide whether we are still on a saddle point), presumably because there are less directions going down [i.e. we are close to the global minimum]</li>

                      <li>experts now suspect that, for sufficiently large neural networks, most local minima have a low cost function value, and that it is not important to find a true global minimum rather than to find a point in parameter space that has low but not minimal cost</li>
                      <li>Many practitioners attribute nearly all difficulty with neural network optimization to <strong>local minima</strong>.

                              <li>A <strong>test</strong> that can rule out local minima as the problem is to <strong><mark>plot the norm of the gradient over time</mark></strong>. If the norm of the gradient does not shrink to insignificant size [same problem as discussed <a href="#gradient_fluctuating_on_plateau">here</a>], the problem is neither local minima nor any other kind of critical point.

      <li>The team of Yoshua Bengio have experimentally found that when optimising the parameters of high-dimensional neural nets, there effectively are no local minima. Instead, there are saddle points which are local minima in some dimensions but not all. This means that training can slow down quite a lot in these points, until the network figures out how to escape, but as long as we’re willing to wait long enough then it will find a way.</li>
      <li>Given one specific dimension, there is some small probability $p$ with which a point is a local minimum, but not a global minimum, in that dimension. Now, the probability of a point in a $1000$-dimensional space being an incorrect local minimum in all of these would be $p^{1000}$, which is just astronomically small. However, the probability of it being a local minimum in some of these dimensions is actually quite high. And when we get these minima in many dimensions at once, then training can appear to be stuck until it finds the right direction.</li>
      <li>In addition, this probability $p$ will increase as the loss function gets closer to the global minimum.  This means that if we do ever end up at a genuine local minimum, then for all intents and purposes it will be close enough to the global minimum that it will not matter.</li>

  <li><a href="#Goodfellow_2016">Goodfellow_2016</a>
    <ul>
      <li>For many high-dimensional non-convex functions, local minima (and maxima) are in fact rare compared to another kind of point with zero gradient: a saddle point.</li>
      <li>Some points around a saddle point have greater cost than the saddle point, while others have a lower cost.</li>
      <li>At a saddle point, the <strong>Hessian matrix</strong> has both positive and negative eigenvalues.
        <ul>
          <li>Points lying along eigenvectors associated with positive eigenvalues have greater cost than the saddle point, while points lying along negative eigenvalues have lower value.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>We can think of a saddle point as being a local minimum along one cross-section [sozusagen als würde man mit einer Ebene senkrecht durch den Graph schneiden] of the cost function and a local maximum along another cross-section. See figure 4.5 for an illustration.</li>

<h3 id="shuffling-the-examples">Shuffling the Examples</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Müller, Montavon:
    <ul>
      <li>Networks learn the fastest from the most unexpected sample. Therefore, it is advisable to <mark>**choose a sample at each iteration that is the most unfamiliar to the system**</mark>.
        <ul>
          <li>Note, this applies only to stochastic learning since the order of input presentation is irrelevant for batch.</li>
          <li>Of course, there is no simple way to know <strong>which inputs are information rich</strong>,
            <ul>
              <li>however, a very simple <strong>trick</strong> that crudely implements this idea is to simply <strong>choose successive examples that are from different classes</strong> since training examples belonging to the same class will most likely contain similar information.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Another heuristic for judging how much new information a training example contains is to <strong>examine the error between the network output and the target value</strong> when this input is presented.
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>large error indicates that this input has not been learned</strong> by the network and so contains a lot of new information.</li>
          <li>Therefore, it makes sense to <strong>present this input more frequently</strong>.</li>
          <li>Of course, by “large” we mean relative to all of the other training examples.</li>
          <li>As the network trains, these relative errors will change and so should the <strong>frequency of presentation</strong> for a particular input pattern.</li>
          <li>A method that modifies the probability of appearance of each pattern is called an <mark>**emphasizing scheme**</mark>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>However, <strong>one must be careful when perturbing the normal frequencies of input examples</strong> because this changes the relative importance that the network places on different examples. This may or may not be desirable.
        <ul>
          <li>For example, this technique applied to data containing <strong>outliers</strong> can be disastrous because outliers can produce large errors yet should not be presented frequently.</li>
          <li>On the other hand, this technique can be particularly beneficial for <strong>boosting the performance for infrequently occurring inputs</strong>, e.g. /z/ in phoneme recognition.</li>

      <li>“The average of each input variable over the training set should be close to zero.”
        <ul>
          <li>When all of the components of an input vector are positive, all of the updates of weights that feed into a node will be the same sign (i.e. $\text{sign}(\delta)$).
            <ul>
              <li>biases the updates in a particular direction</li>
              <li>As a result, these weights can only all decrease or all increase <strong>together</strong> for a given input pattern.
                <ul>
                  <li>Thus, if a weight vector must change direction it can only do so by <strong>zigzagging</strong> which is inefficient and thus very slow.

          </li>
          <li>In the above example, the inputs were all positive. However, <strong>in general, any shift of the average input away from zero will bias the updates in a particular direction</strong> and thus slow down learning.</li>
          <li>Therefore, it is good to <strong>shift the inputs so that the average over the training set is close to zero</strong>.
            <ul>
              <li>This heuristic should be applied <strong>at all layers</strong> which means that we want the average of the outputs of a node to be close to zero because these outputs are the inputs to the next layer [19], chapter 10.
                <ul>

              <li>In other words, the <strong>two variables are independent</strong> (the system of equations is diagonal).</li>

<h3 id="sigmoids">Sigmoids</h3>

<ul>
  <li>LeCun, “Efficient BackProp”:
    <ol>
      <li>Symmetric sigmoids such as hyperbolic tangent often converge faster than the standard logistic function.</li>
      <li>A recommended sigmoid is: $f(x) = 1.7159\tanh\frac{2}{3}x$. Since the $\tanh$ function is sometimes computationally expensive, an approximation of it by a ratio of polynomials can be used instead.
        <ul>
          <li>The constants in the recommended sigmoid given above have been chosen so that, when used with transformed inputs (see previous discussion), the <strong>variance of the outputs will also be close to 1</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>because the <strong>effective gain of the sigmoid is roughly 1</strong> over its useful range.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Properties:
            <ul>
              <li>(a) $f(±1) = ±1$,</li>
              <li>(b) the second derivative is a maximum at $x = 1$ [siehe “1.4.5 Choosing Target Values”], and</li>
              <li>(c) the effective gain is close to $1$.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sometimes it is helpful to add a small linear term, e.g. $f(x) = \tanh(x) + ax$ so as to avoid flat spots.
        <ul>
          <li>One of the potential problems with using symmetric sigmoids is that the <strong>error surface can be very flat near the origin</strong>.
            <ul>
              <li>For this reason it is good to <strong>avoid initializing with very small weights</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Because of the saturation of the sigmoids, the <strong>error surface is also flat far from the origin</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Adding a small linear term</strong> to the sigmoid can sometimes help avoid the flat regions (see chapter 9).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Sigmoids that are symmetric about the origin are preferred for the same reason that inputs should be normalized, namely, because they are more likely to produce outputs (which are inputs to the next layer) that are on average close to zero.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="weight-initialization">Weight initialization</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>sigmoidal</strong> activation functions have the “vanishing gradients” problem, <strong>ReLU</strong> does not!
    <blockquote>
      <p>Nevertheless, this Xavier initialization (after Glorot’s first name) is a neat trick that works well in practice. However, along came rectified linear units (ReLU), a non-linearity that is scale-invariant around 0 and does not saturate at large input values. This seemingly solved both of the problems the sigmoid function had; or were they just alleviated? I am unsure of how widely used Xavier initialization is, but if it is not, perhaps it is because ReLU seemingly eliminated this problem. <a href="http://deepdish.io/">http://deepdish.io/</a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://deepdish.io/">http://deepdish.io/</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>First, let’s go back to the time of sigmoidal activation functions and initialization of parameters using i.i.d. Gaussian or uniform distributions with fairly <strong>arbitrarily set variances</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>Building deep networks was difficult because of <strong>exploding or vanishing activations and gradients</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Let’s take <strong>activations</strong> first:
        <ul>
          <li>If all your parameters are <strong>too small</strong>,
            <ul>
              <li>the <strong>variance of your activations will drop in each layer</strong>.</li>
              <li>This is a problem if your activation <strong>function is sigmoidal</strong>, since it is <strong>approximately linear close to 0</strong>.
                <ul>
                  <li>That is, you <strong>gradually lose your non-linearity</strong>, which means there is <strong>no benefit to having multiple layers</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If, on the other hand, your activations become <strong>larger and larger</strong>,
            <ul>
              <li>then your <strong>activations will saturate</strong> and become meaningless, with <strong>gradients approaching 0</strong>.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Abstract:
        <ul>
          <li>[…] <strong>overfitting</strong> is a serious problem in such networks.</li>
          <li>Large networks are also slow to use, making it <strong>difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Dropout</strong> is a technique for addressing this problem.
            <ul>
              <li>The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training.
                <ul>
                  <li>This prevents units from co-adapting too much.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>During training, dropout samples from an <strong>exponential number</strong> of different “thinned” networks.</li>
              <li>At test time, it is easy to <strong>approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks</strong> by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights.</li>
              <li>This significantly <strong>reduces overfitting</strong> and gives major <strong>improvements over other regularization methods</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>there are $2^n$ (Mächtigkeit der Potenzmenge für n Elemente) thinned NNs, where $n$ is the number of hidden units
        <ul>
          <li>but still only $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ parameters (soll heißen Dropout führt keine neuen Parameter ein)
            <ul>
              <li>Das $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ ist ein upper bound? [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension#VC_dimension_of_a_neural_network">VC dimension of a NN</a>]</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>at test time use $p\mathbf{w}$, so that the output of a node <strong>at test time</strong> is the expected output <strong>at training time</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-for-regularizing-deep-neural-networks/">source</a>: Note: The rescaling of the weights can be performed at training time instead, after each weight update at the end of the mini-batch. This is sometimes called “inverse dropout” and does not require any modification of weights during training. Both the Keras and PyTorch deep learning libraries implement dropout in this way.</li>

      <li><strong>Ensembles of neural networks</strong> with different model configurations are known to <strong>reduce overfitting</strong>, <strong>but</strong> require the <strong>additional computational expense</strong> of training and maintaining multiple models.</li>
      <li>A single model can be used to <strong>simulate having a large number of different network architectures</strong> by randomly dropping out nodes during training.
        <ul>
          <li>This is called <strong>dropout</strong> and offers a very <strong>computationally cheap</strong> and remarkably effective <strong>regularization method</strong> to <strong>reduce overfitting</strong> and <strong>improve generalization error</strong> in deep neural networks of all kinds.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Large weights</strong> in a neural network <strong>are a sign</strong> of a more complex network that has overfit the training data.</li>
      <li>Probabilistically dropping out nodes in the network is a simple and effective <strong>regularization</strong> method.</li>
      <li>A <strong>large</strong> network with <strong>more training</strong> and the use of a <strong>weight constraint</strong> are <strong>suggested</strong> when using dropout.
        <ul>
          <li>large NN:
            <ul>
              <li>It is common for <strong>larger</strong> networks (more layers or more nodes) to <strong>more easily overfit</strong> the training data.</li>
              <li>When using dropout regularization, it is possible to use larger networks with less risk of overfitting. In fact, a large network (more nodes per layer) may be required as dropout will probabilistically reduce the capacity of the network.</li>
              <li>A good <strong>rule of thumb</strong> is to divide the number of nodes in the layer before dropout by the proposed dropout rate and use that as the number of nodes in the new network that uses dropout. For example, a network with 100 nodes and a proposed dropout rate of 0.5 will require 200 nodes (100 / 0.5) when using dropout.</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>weight constraint:
            <ul>
              <li>Network weights will increase in size in response to the probabilistic removal of layer activations.</li>
              <li>Large weight size can be a sign of an unstable network.</li>
              <li>To counter this effect a <strong>weight constraint</strong> can be imposed to force the norm (magnitude) of all weights in a layer to be below a specified value.
                <ul>
                  <li>For example, the <strong>maximum norm constraint</strong> is recommended with a value between 3-4.</li>
