## Latex

- vim italics issue (because Latex uses underscores):
    - vim will **display** italic text **as italics** as long as the environment variable `TERM` is set to `xterm-256color` (looks ugly!)
    - if `TERM` is not set to anything, vim will **highlight** the italic text (looks even more ugly!)
