# AirDrop 

- works over Bluetooth (though WLAN must be enabled)
- "AirDrop uses Bluetooth to create a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi network between the devices. That means you don't need to be connected to your router or even the internet in order to have an AirDrop connection. You do have to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on, however.", [source](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-airdrop-how-does-it-work-1994512)

## File Transfer From iPad to iPhone without Wifi

- tap on "Share" button on **both** devices
  - when the other device is discovered, it will be listed in the AirDrop field in the "Share" menu of each device
