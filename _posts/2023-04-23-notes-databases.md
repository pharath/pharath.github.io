# NoSQL

Wikipedia:
- A NoSQL (originally referring to "**non-SQL**" or "**non-relational**") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. 
- Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name "NoSQL" was only coined in the early 21st century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. 
- NoSQL databases are **increasingly used** in big data and real-time web applications. 
- NoSQL systems are also sometimes called "**Not only SQL**" to emphasize that 
  - they **may support SQL-like query languages** or 
  - **sit alongside SQL databases** in polyglot-persistent architectures.
    - **Polyglot persistence** is a term that refers to using multiple data storage technologies within a single system, in order to meet varying data storage needs.
