# JavaScript (aka ECMAScript aka ES)

## Versions, Revisions

- ES6 = ECMAScript 6 = ECMAScript 2015
  - arrow functions

## Crash Course

see [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c) ([Code](https://embed.plnkr.co/plunk/8ujYdL1BxZftGoS4Cf14))

## Terminology

- **JavaScript runtime** refers to where your javascript code is executed when you run it. That said, javascript can be executed on google chrome, in which case your javascript runtime is v8, if on mozilla - it is spidermonkey, if IE - then its chakra and if on node, again its v8. ([stackoverflow comment under answer](https://stackoverflow.com/q/30838412))
- **I/O**: In practice, the **web browser** or other **runtime system** provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

## Implementations

- Google V8
  - see this discussion on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30838412/what-is-javascript-runtime)
  - see [Terminology](#terminology) &rarr; "JavaScript runtime"
  - from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)):
    - developed by the Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers
    - V8 compiles ECMAScript directly to native machine code using **just-in-time compilation** before executing it
      - **JIT compilation** aka dynamic compilation ( [source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/just-in-time-compilation-explained/) )
        - a method for improving the performance of **interpreted** programs
        - During execution the program may be compiled into native code to improve its performance. 
        - Advantages:
          - Dynamic compilation has some advantages over static compilation. 
          - When running `Java` or `C#` applications, the runtime environment can **profile** the application while it is being run. 
          - This allows for more optimized code to be generated.
          - If the behavior of the application changes while it is running, the runtime environment can recompile the code.
    - The compiled code is additionally **optimized** (and re-optimized) dynamically **at runtime**, based on heuristics of the code's execution profile. 
    - **Optimization techniques** used include 
      - inlining
      - elision of expensive runtime properties
      - inline caching.
    - used in
      - Chromium-based web browsers
      - Firefox - parts of V8 ported to the browser for regular expressions parsing
      - many more apps (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)))

## Formatting, Syntax Highlighting

- Install `javascript` syntax highlighting using `nvim-treesitter`.
- Install `javascript` formatting using `coc-prettier`.

# Syntax

## Print

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways: [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_output.asp)
- Writing into an HTML element, using `innerHTML`.
- Writing into the HTML output using `document.write()`.
- Writing into an alert box, using `window.alert()`.
- Writing into the browser console, using `console.log()`.

`.constructor` property and `.constructor.name` [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/332429)
- Check `this` bindings, etc

## Variables

### let 

- only use this, if you know the variable will change, otherwise use `const`
  - makes the code more robust

### const

[mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)
- creates block-scoped **constants**
- The value of a constant 
  - can't be changed through **reassignment** (i.e. by using the assignment operator `=`), and 
  - it can't be **redeclared** (i.e. through a variable declaration). 
- However, if a constant is an **object** or **array** its **properties** or **items** can be updated or removed.

## Types

Check types via `typeof` operator
```js
typeof Math.LN2 === "number";
typeof declaredButUndefinedVariable === "undefined";
typeof undeclaredVariable === "undefined";
typeof { a: 1 } === "object";
```

For objects use the `.constructor` property and `.constructor.name` [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/332429)

## Numbers

### Number.prototype.toLocaleString

```js
const currencyOptions = {
  minimumFractionDigits: 2,
  maximumFractionDigits: 2,
}

total.toLocaleString(undefined, currencyOptions)
```
- Convert `total` from a number to a string with two decimal places. 
- this will also convert the number to a string according to the numerical conventions that match the browser's locale
- Use `undefined` as the first argument to `toLocaleString` to use the system locale rather than specifying a locale

## Arrays

### Spread

[digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-destructuring-rest-parameters-and-spread-syntax-in-javascript#spread)

I.e. `...` notation, e.g.
```js
const cart = [...state.cart];
```

Use cases:
- instead of `const concatArray = array1.concat(array2)` use `const concatArray = [...array1, ...array2]`
  - both methods do not change the existing arrays, but instead return a new array
- instead of `const pushedArray = array1.push(array2[0])` (modifies `array1`) use `const pushedArray = [...array1, array2]` (does not modify `array1`)
- shallow copying
  - i.e. creating a new array from the existing one and adding a new item to the end **without changing the existing one**

In JavaScript, when you create an object or array and assign it to another variable, you are not actually creating a new object - you are **passing a reference**.
- **Shallow Copy**: spread allows to make a **shallow copy** of an array or object **without changing the existing one**
  - i.e. any **top level properties** will be **cloned**, but **nested objects** will still be **passed by reference**

### Array.prototype.slice

[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9050345/selecting-last-element-in-javascript-array)

Get the last element:
```js
var my_array = /* some array here */;
var last_element = my_array[my_array.length - 1];
```

- Do not use `my_array.slice(-1)[0]`, it is too slow.

### Array.prototype.splice

[mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice)

**return**: An array containing the deleted elements.

The `splice()` method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements **in place** (i.e. `splice()` modifies the original array). 
- To access part of an array without modifying it, see `slice()`.
- a **mutating method**: It may change the content of `this`.
- Although strings are also array-like, this method is **not** suitable to be applied on them, as strings are immutable.
- **Negative index** counts back from the end of the array.

```js
some_array.splice(start)   # remove all elements after index "start"
some_array.splice(start, deleteCount)   # remove "deleteCount" elements after index "start" and keep the rest
some_array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1)
some_array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, itemN)
```

### Array.prototype.reduce

[mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)

The `reduce()` method executes a user-supplied **"reducer" callback function** on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.

**Initial value**: The first time that the callback is run there is no "return value of the previous calculation". If supplied, an **initial value** may be used in its place. Otherwise **the array element at index 0** is used as the initial value and iteration starts from the next element (index 1 instead of index 0).

Example:
```js
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
const initialValue = 0;
const sumWithInitial = array1.reduce(
  (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
  initialValue
);

console.log(sumWithInitial);
// Expected output: 10
```

### Array.prototype.indexOf

```js
array1.indexOf(x)
```
- index of the **first instance** of `x` in an `array1`
- return `-1` if `x` is not present

## Lists

In JavaScript:
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

## Functions

### Define Functions

Ways to Define Functions:
- function declaration [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)
- function expressions [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)
- method definition [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)
  - a shorter syntax for defining a function property in an object initializer. It can also be used in classes.
  - [examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#methods)

### Anonymous Functions

From [javascripttutorial.net](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-anonymous-functions/):

An anonymous function is a function without a name.
```js
(function () {
   //...
});
```

An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation. Therefore, you often need to **assign it to a variable**:
```js
let show = function () {
    console.log('Anonymous function');
};

show();
```
In this example, the anonymous function **has no name** between the `function` keyword and parentheses `()`.

In practice, you often pass anonymous functions **as arguments to other functions**. For example:
```js
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('Execute later after 1 second')
}, 1000);
```

#### Arrow Function Notation

ES6 introduced **arrow function** expressions that provide ~~a shorthand for declaring anonymous functions~~.
- incorrect, see [comment under this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27977567)
```js
let show = () => console.log('Anonymous function');
```

From [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp):
If you have **only one parameter** (here: `val`), you can skip the parentheses as well:
```js
hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;
// instead, you can use
hello = val => "Hello " + val;
```

#### Anonymous Functions as arguments

In practice, you often pass anonymous functions as arguments to other functions:
```js
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('Execute later after 1 second')
}, 1000);
```

## this

### Context

**context**: In JavaScript, **context** refers to an object. Within an object, the keyword `this` refers to that object (i.e. `self`), and provides an interface to the properties and methods that are members of that object. When a function is executed, the keyword `this` refers to the object that the function is executed in. [source](https://blog.kevinchisholm.com/javascript/context-object-literals/)

### In Arrow Functions

**in an arrow function**: You cannot rebind `this` in an arrow function. *It will always be defined as the context in which it was defined*. If you require `this` to be meaningful you should use a normal function. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33308151)

[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp) (scroll down to section "What About this?")
- In **regular functions** the `this` keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.
- With **arrow functions** the `this` keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

**Try these examples!!!**
- [example with normal function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_arrow_function6)
  - shows that **for a regular function** `this` will always be the **caller**
- [example with arrow function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_arrow_function7)
  - shows that **for an arrow function** it does not matter who is the caller, `this` will always be the "**definer**"
- also modify the example above and try running **Example 1 and 2** below (modified from [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/understanding-this-bind-call-and-apply-in-javascript#arrow-functions)): 
  - Note: 
    - in Example 1: `document.write('\n')` does not work in the code below: In HTML, all whitespace (including newlines) is collapsed and treated as a single space. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10225924)
    - in Example 1: `<br/>` is the XHTML version of `<br>`. Since you're not using XHTML, you would just use `<br>`. (How do I know you're not using XHTML? Because you're using `document.write`, which you can't use in XHTML.) [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10225925)

Example 1: "this" in arrow functions
```html
<script>
const whoAmI = {
  name: 'Leslie Knope',
  regularFunction: function() {
    document.write(this.name + '<br/>')
  },
  regularFunction2: function() {
    document.write(this.name + '<br/>')
  },
  arrowFunction: () => {
    document.write(this)
  },
}

whoAmI.regularFunction() // "Leslie Knope"
whoAmI.regularFunction2() // "Leslie Knope"
whoAmI.arrowFunction() // [object Window]
</script>
```

Example 2: `event.currentTarget`, "this" in arrow functions
```html
<script>

const button = document.createElement('button')
button.textContent = 'Click me'
document.body.append(button)

class Display {
  constructor() {
    this.displayString = 'New text'

    // In an arrow function "this" always refers to the context (=object) in which the 
    // arrow function was defined, ie. here the "Display" class.
    const changeText = event => {
      event.target.textContent = this.displayString;
    }
 
    button.addEventListener('click', getText)
    button.addEventListener('click', changeText)
   
    // Here, "this" refers to the "event.currentTarget" object, ie. "button" which
    // is outside of the "Display" class.
    function getText(event) {
    	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this.textContent
    }    
  }
}

new Display()

</script>
```

Sidenote about Example 2: 
- Why can we call `getText()` before it is defined? 
- Why can we not call `changeText()` before it is defined?
- **answer**: see [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/261599/why-can-i-use-a-function-before-its-defined-in-javascript)

### Some Scenarios 

[source](https://blog.kevinchisholm.com/javascript/context-object-literals/):
- When a function executes in the global context, `this` refers to the global, or `window` object
- When a function is a method of an Object, `this` refers to that object (unless it is manually executed in the context of a different object)
- When a function executes inside of another function (no matter how deeply nested), `this` refers to the object whose context within which it is executed
- When you instantiate a constructor function, inside of the instance object, `this` refers to the instance object

# TypeScript (Microsoft)

- a **strict syntactical superset** of JavaScript
- adds optional **static typing** to the language
- designed for the development of large applications
- transpiles to JavaScript
- As it is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. 
- developed and maintained by Microsoft

# Web APIs

[mdn list of Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)

"Web APIs are typically used with **JavaScript**, although this doesn't always have to be the case." 

"JavaScript has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM)." ["JavaScript" Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

## DOM

**One** Web API.

### Interfaces

#### Element

##### Instance Properties

- `.innerHTML` gets or sets the HTML or XML markup contained within the element. [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML)

#### Event

##### Syntax

**HTML** Events
```html
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

**JavaScript** Events
- either: `object.onclick = function(){myScript};`
- or: `object.addEventListener("click", myScript);` ( see `.addEventListener()` )

[React Events](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
- React events are named using [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a **function** as the event handler, rather than a **string**.
- e.g. `<button onClick={function}>`

##### `event` Object

`event`
- One can access the current event through `window.event`. Just using `event` is implicitly accessing `window.event`. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6426581)
- a global variable

##### `event.target`, `event.currentTarget`

- `.currentTarget`: [doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget)
  - "always refers to the element to which the event handler has been attached, as opposed to `Event.target`, which identifies the element on which the event occurred and which may be its descendant."
- `.target`: [doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target)
  - "a reference to the object onto which the event was dispatched."

"We're using `event.target` to get the element that was the target of the event (that is, the innermost element). If we wanted to access the element that handled this event (in this case the container) we could use `event.currentTarget`." [mdn: note below this section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_delegation)

"Here you can see we are including an **event object**, `e`, in the function, and in the function setting a background color style on `e.target` — which is the button itself. The `target` property of the event object is always a reference to the element the event occurred upon. So, in this example, we are setting a random background color on the button, not the page." [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_objects)
- "Note: You can use any name you like for the event object — you just need to choose a name that you can then use to reference it inside the event handler function. `e`/`evt`/`event` is most commonly used by developers because they are short and easy to remember. It's always good to be consistent - with yourself, and with others if possible."

##### onClick (Event)

- in React notation: `<button onClick={function}>` 

##### Event Handler

- `some_element.addEventListener()` method
  - The `addEventListener()` method attaches an **event handler** to the specified **element**.
  - The `addEventListener()` method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers.
  - You can add many event handlers to one element.
  - You can add many event handlers of the same type to one element, i.e two "click" events.
  - You can add event listeners to any DOM object not only HTML elements. i.e the window object.
