    - I'd like to see more work done that would really be helpful for the program I've been talking about is regarding memory because an attention because the the kind of memory that we've put in you on that these days I mean like the extended memory neural nets like neural Turing machines and and and all those they're not the kind of memory that you find in human brains really it doesn't look very plausible so it looks like a lot of our memory and the way that we select like attention is is more of a process of the dynamic coming from the dynamics of the circuit which leads to sort of concentration of activity in a few selected places rather than copying information in some memory bank and then retrieving it 
    - TODO: yeah I mean another area the intersection with biology of course is you you mentioned sample efficiency and and you know natural selection is
